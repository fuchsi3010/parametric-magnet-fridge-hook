# Parametric Magnet Fridge Hook

This is the Repo for an OpenScad Project of a Magnetic Fridge hook i want to build.

It differs from other magnetic fridge hooks in:
- geometry of the hook: i need a logn and thin hook for hanging my dustpan (IKEA Pepprig)
- enclosure: magnets are enclosed, 0.2 mm from the bottom of the print
- parametric: can adjust the size and amount of magnets per the 3 slots (e.g. one 12x3 magnet or two 8x2 magnets)
